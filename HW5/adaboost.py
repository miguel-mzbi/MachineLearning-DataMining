# Input: number of iterations L
#        numpy matrix X of features, with n rows (samples), d columns (features)
#            X[i,j] is the j-th feature of the i-th sample
#        numpy vector y of labels, with n rows (samples), 1 column
#            y[i] is the label (+1 or -1) of the i-th sample
# Output: numpy vector alpha of weights, with L rows, 1 column
#         numpy vector theta of feature indices, with L rows, 1 column
def run(L,X,y):
    # Your code goes here
    return (alpha, theta)
