# Input: number of features F
#        numpy matrix X of features, with n rows (samples), d columns (features)
#            X[i,j] is the j-th feature of the i-th sample
#        numpy vector y of scalar values, with n rows (samples), 1 column
#            y[i] is the scalar value of the i-th sample
# Output: numpy vector of selected features S, with F rows, 1 column
#         numpy vector thetaS, with F rows, 1 column
#             thetaS[0] corresponds to the weight of feature S[0]
#             thetaS[1] corresponds to the weight of feature S[1]
#             and so on and so forth
def run(F,X,y):
    # Your code goes here
    return (S, thetaS)
